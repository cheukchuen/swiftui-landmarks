# SwiftUI Essentials

## Creating and Combining Views

This tutorial guides you through building _Landmarks_ — an app for discovering and sharing the places you love. You’ll start by building the view that shows a landmark’s details.

To lay out the views, Landmarks uses _stacks_ to combine and layer the image and text view components. To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component. As you refine the view’s design, Xcode provides real-time feedback so you can see how those changes translate into code.

### Notes

- You use the `@State` attribute to establish a source of truth for data in your app that you can modify from more than one view. SwiftUI manages the underlying storage and automatically updates views that depend on the value.

- By prefixing a state variable with `$`, you pass a binding, which is like a reference to the underlying value. When the user interacts with the map, the map updates the region value to match the part of the map that’s currently visible in the user interface.
